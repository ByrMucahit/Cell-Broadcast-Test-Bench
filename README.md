# Cell Broadcast Bench

# Description
Cell Broadcast Bench is a service to providing e-communicate. Data, which's given by user,'s sended from somewhere to other where with using moduls.
It has options such as 2G, 3G, 3G,which each  have different inputs. Generally, Cell Broadcast Bench is used for e-communicate, but this project more local than I told.
This project's purpose is taking data that's sended using moduls, then insert this data to database, that's why this project is divided into two sub-discipline such as 
Front-End and Back-End. 
Cell Broadcast Bench has four interfaces as home, 2G, 3G, 4G. Each interface has own input and design. Project is developed using react that's library of javascript and its dependencies. Those dependencies're [![semantic-ui version](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/semantic-ui.svg)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/semantic-ui/),[![formik-version](https://badge.fury.io/js/formik.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/formik), [![axios version](https://badge.fury.io/js/axios.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/axios). React works based on compenent. It uses component architecture during creation. Component architecutre provides readable, usable, reusable, scalable to project. Designing is more tidy and easier, that's why It had been used.
In Back-End side, layered architecture is built through using boot spring framework which include from JAVA. We had thought Bootspring and its tools is enough,and it was. 
Database side, while working, MySql's enough about request of back-end side.
While developing project, Some faced problems're make interact between front-end and back-end. Firstly, axios that's dependency of react had been used for http request to sending data, but It hadn't been success. If You can work it, Please interact with me.


# Installation
React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:

*Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
